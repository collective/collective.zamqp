AMQP
----

The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol [#amqp]_ is a very performant protocol that is implemented
in many platform, many languages and thus can exchange messages between many framework/applications.

The most known AMQP open source servers are: `RabbitMQ <http://www.rabbitmq.com>`_ and `Qpid <http://qpid.apache.org/>`_

Existing Python AMQP libraries
------------------------------

Python itself has different libraries available that implement the protocol. Here are the two most known libraries:

    * `amqplib <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/amqplib>`_
    * `txAMQP <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/txAMQP>`_

As you might not want to deal with a "low level" API, there is a higher level API available via
`carrot <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/carrot>`_.

Why this package ?
------------------

AFAIK Zope 2 unfortunately doesn't have any integration (Twisted does so I guess it might be
easier to implement it with Zope 3).

The Ñ–dea behind this project is to provide a messaging solution together with the observer pattern
in Zope [#events]_. An image might help to understand what we try to implement here:

As you might also see, AMQP also permit asynchronous events in Zope 2.
