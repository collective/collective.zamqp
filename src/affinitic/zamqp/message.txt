Message
=======

A MessageWrapper enables transaction support and defered acknoledgement.

This means that we a message is received it is registered in the transaction so that if someone acknoledge the message, the acknoledgement will be send only if the transaction is correctly commited. Also if a message is acknoledge and for some reason the transaction is aborted, the message acknoledgement never gets sent.
